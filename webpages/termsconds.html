                This page outlines the Terms and Conditions (the “Agreement”) governing the provision of virtual assistant and automation services by Empower VA Services (“VA,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) to you, the client (“Client” or “you”). By engaging our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.

        <!-- General Terms -->
        <div class="term-card">
            <h3>1. Services and Scope of Work</h3>
            <p>The VA will provide services as detailed in the agreed-upon Proposal or Service Agreement. Any changes to the scope of work must be agreed upon in writing by both parties. The VA operates as an independent contractor, not an employee of the Client, and is not responsible for employee benefits, taxes, or superannuation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-card">
            <h3>2. Client Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>The Client agrees to provide all necessary information, materials, and access (e.g., software, logins) required for the VA to perform the Services in a timely manner. The Client is responsible for making key decisions and must review all work submitted by the VA within a reasonable timeframe, providing clear and prompt feedback.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Apps Script Automation Terms -->
        <div class="term-card border-teal border-l-8">
            <h3 class="text-2xl">Terms for Google Apps Script Automation Services</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800 font-semibold">The following terms apply specifically to the design and implementation of bespoke Google Apps Script solutions.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-700">
                <li><strong class="text-teal">50% Non-Refundable Deposit:</strong> Due to the bespoke nature of automation services, a 50% non-refundable deposit of the total project fee is required before any development work begins. This secures your project in our schedule and covers the initial costs of consultation, planning, and design.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-teal">Issue Resolution Period:</strong> We stand by the quality of our code. Upon delivery of the final script, the Client has a 90-day period to report any bugs or issues with the script's functionality as defined in the original project scope. The Client agrees to allow the VA the full 90 days to investigate and resolve any reported issues.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-teal">Our Commitment & Refund Policy:</strong> We are committed to delivering a high-quality, functional automation script. We offer a 90-day support period to ensure everything works smoothly for you. In the unlikely event that a technical issue arises within this period that we are unable to resolve, we will happily provide a full refund of the final payment. Our goal is your complete satisfaction with the solution we build together.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-teal">Disclaimer on Google Platform Changes:</strong> The Client acknowledges that Google Apps Script operates on Google's infrastructure. Google may make changes to its Workspace platform, APIs, or services at any time, which could potentially affect the script's functionality. The VA cannot be held liable for disruptions caused by these external platform updates. However, we are committed to the long-term success of your automation. If you believe a change by Google has affected your script's performance, even after the 90-day support period, please contact us. We will happily investigate and work with you on a solution.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="term-card">
            <h3>3. Data Protection & Privacy (GDPR Compliant)</h3>
            <p>Both parties agree to comply with all applicable data protection laws, including the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. The VA will process personal data only as instructed by the Client and will implement appropriate security measures. As a Data Processor, Empower VA Services is committed to assisting you, the Client (as Data Controller), in fulfilling your GDPR obligations, including maintaining strict confidentiality and providing reasonable assistance with data subject requests.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-card">
            <h3>4. Fees & Payment</h3>
            <p>Fees are set out in the Proposal or Service Agreement. Invoices are payable within 14 days. Late payments may incur a late fee of 5% per month on the outstanding balance, and services may be suspended until payment is received. All agreed-upon expenses will be invoiced separately. All fees are exclusive of VAT, which will be added where applicable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-card">
            <h3>5. Working Hours & Communication</h3>
            <p>The VA generally operates Monday-Friday, 10 AM – 6 PM UK time and aims to respond to communications within 24 hours on workdays. Work requested outside of these hours may incur additional fees by prior agreement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-card">
            <h3>6. Confidentiality & Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p>Both parties agree to keep all confidential information private. This obligation continues after the termination of our agreement. Upon full payment, all intellectual property rights in the work created specifically for the Client will transfer to the Client. The VA retains the right to use non-confidential samples of work for portfolio purposes, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-card">
            <h3>7. Limitation of Liability & Indemnification</h3>
            <p>The VA’s total liability for any claim shall not exceed the total fees paid by the Client for the Services in the three months preceding the claim. The VA will not be liable for any indirect or consequential damages. The Client agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the VA from any claims or liabilities arising from the Client’s breach of this Agreement or use of the services.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-card">
            <h3>8. Termination</h3>
            <p>Either party may terminate this Agreement with 7 days' written notice. The VA may terminate immediately if the Client fails to make payments or breaches this Agreement. Upon termination, the Client agrees to pay for all Services rendered up to the termination date.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-card">
            <h3>9. Governing Law & General Provisions</h3>
            <p>This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Scotland, and both parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Scottish courts. In case of a dispute, both parties agree to attempt good-faith negotiation first. The VA reserves the right to modify these Terms and will communicate any changes in writing. This Agreement, together with any Proposal, constitutes the entire agreement between us.</p>
