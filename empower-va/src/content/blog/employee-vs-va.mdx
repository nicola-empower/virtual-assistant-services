# Employee vs. Virtual Assistant: Where Does Your Business Budget Really Go?

As a business owner, you're always looking for smart ways to grow, to streamline, and to make every pound count. When the workload starts piling up, the natural instinct is often to hire an employee. It's the path many businesses have always taken. But what if I told you that the actual cost of bringing on a traditional employee is usually far more than just their salary?

**It's a bit of a hidden iceberg, really, with a whole lot more lurking beneath the surface.**



Let's unpack this, shall we?

## The Full Picture: Costs Beyond Salary for an Employee

When you take on an employee, you're not just agreeing to pay their monthly wage. There's a whole host of other financial commitments that quickly add up, often surprising businesses who haven't factored them in.

* **National Insurance & Pensions:** These are big ones. As an employer, you're legally required to contribute to both of these for your staff, adding a significant chunk to their overall cost.
* **Workspace & Overheads:** Think about it: a desk, a chair, a computer, software licenses, even the electricity and heating for their space. For remote employees, you might still be providing equipment and tech support.
* **Holidays & Sick Leave:** Every employee is entitled to paid holiday, and of course, there's sick pay. These are essential benefits, but they are still costs to your business for time when direct work isn't being done.
* **Recruitment & Training:** Finding the right person can be a lengthy and expensive journey. Advertising costs, potentially hefty recruitment agency fees, and the valuable time you spend interviewing all add up before they even start.
* **Insurance & Compliance:** You'll need employer's liability insurance, and there's the ongoing administration of HR, ensuring you're compliant with all employment laws.
