            >
            Due to the bespoke nature of automation services, a 50% non-refundable
            deposit of the total project fee is required before any development work
            begins. This secures your project in our schedule and covers the initial
            costs of consultation, planning, and design.

            >
            We stand by the quality of our code. Upon delivery of the final script,
            the Client has a 90-day period to report any bugs or issues with the script's
            functionality as defined in the original project scope. The Client agrees
            to allow the VA the full 90 days to investigate and resolve any reported
            issues.

            We are committed to delivering a high-quality, functional automation script.
            We offer a 90-day support period to ensure everything works smoothly for
            you. In the unlikely event that a technical issue arises within this period
            that we are unable to resolve, we will happily provide a full refund of
            the final payment. Our goal is your complete satisfaction with the solution
            we build together.

            >
            The Client acknowledges that Google Apps Script operates on Google's infrastructure.
            Google may make changes to its Workspace platform, APIs, or services at
            any time, which could potentially affect the script's functionality. The
            VA cannot be held liable for disruptions caused by these external platform
            updates. However, we are committed to the long-term success of your automation.
            If you believe a change by Google has affected your script's performance,
            even after the 90-day support period, please contact us. We will happily
            investigate and work with you on a solution.
